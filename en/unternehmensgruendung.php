                        <p>The United Arab Emirates is an emerging business environment and a popular location for companies looking to establish themselves in the region. When deciding to set up a business in the UAE, there are two fundamental options: establishing a company in the Mainland or in one of the many Freezones of the country.</p>
                        <p>Establishing a company in the Mainland means that the company is set up in collaboration with a local sponsor, referred to as an "Emirati Sponsor". The sponsor will hold 51% of the shares in the company, while the foreign investor owns the remaining 49%. However, there are exceptions in certain industries where foreign investors can own 100% of the shares. An example of this is companies in the Dubai Free Trade Zone.</p>
                        <p>Setting up a company in a Freezone, such as the Dubai International Financial Centre or the Jebel Ali Free Zone, offers foreign investors the opportunity to hold 100% of the shares in their company. Freezones also offer tax advantages, a quick setup time, and a simplified registration process. Freezones are ideal for companies operating in trade, logistics, IT, and consulting.</p>
                        <p>However, there are some restrictions when setting up a company in a Freezone. For example, companies established in a Freezone must operate within the boundaries of the Freezone, which means they cannot do business within the country. Companies established in a Freezone can, however, export services and products to other countries, thereby reaching a global audience.</p>
                        <p>In the Mainland, there is also a wider range of business opportunities, as companies can operate in various industries, while specialized industries such as trade, IT, or logistics are preferred in the Freezones. However, setting up a business in the Mainland typically requires more comprehensive business experience and knowledge of the local business culture.</p>
                        <p>Overall, there are various options for setting up a business in the UAE, and each option has its pros and cons. Whether you opt for a Mainland or a Freezone setup depends on your specific needs and requirements. An experienced consulting firm like Pantheon Elite can help you weigh the pros and cons of both options and make the best decision for your business.</p>
